			// incorrect assumption is that the scope is different for all five functions
			// context is the same for all five functions within the result array. Therefore, every time the variable i is incremented, it updates scope — which is shared by all the functions. That’s why any of the 5 functions trying to access i returns 5 (i is equal to 5 when the for-loop exits
