How Javascript Works
====================
-When JavaScript engine executes a script, it creates N execution contexts.
-Execution context is the environment within which the current code is being executed.
-Each execution context has two phases: 
	1. creation phase. (Allocates memory - variables & functions and assign 'undefined' to variables)
	2. execution phase. (Code gets Executed - assign values to variables & method invocation)
-When a script executes for the first time,JavaScript engine creates a 'Global Execution Context' and pushes to callstack.
-For every function call,JavaScript engine creates a new Function Execution Context and that gets added to callstack.
