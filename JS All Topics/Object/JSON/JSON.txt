# JSON (Javascript Object Notation) : 
    1. JSON is a data representation format similar to XML and YAML.
    2.JSON is used for transferring data between servers and web applications. The common use cases are in APIs and config.
    3.JSON is lightweight and easy to write, compared to XML, and integrates easily with most languages.
    4.JSON files have the .JSON extension. Inside the file, the data is represented in key-value pairs in an object.
    5. Inside the JSON file, keys and string values should be enclosed in double quotes. Each key-value pair should be separated by a comma from the other pair.
    6. Thus, JSON is much easier to parse and is faster than XML. It is shorter, doesnâ€™t use end tags, is quicker to read and write and can use arrays, unlike XML.
    7.JSON compatible with multipal languages (for backend)

# DataTypes in JSON :
  * Key => 1. Strings
  * Value => 1. Strings
             2. numbers
             3. Boolean
             4. null
             5. arrays
             6. objects

# JSON Methods:	
    1. JSON.stringify() --> converts object to string.
    2. JSON.parse()  -->    converts string to object.

    - While receiving JSON from a web server, the JSON string needs to be converted to a Javascript object. This can be achieved by using: JSON.parse().
    - To convert a Javascript object to a JSON string, we can use the JSON.stringify() method and send it to the web server.
