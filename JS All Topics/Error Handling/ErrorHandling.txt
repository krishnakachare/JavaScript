Error Handling 
--------------
1. EvalError - 
2. RangeError
3. TypeError
4. SyntaxError
5. ReferenceError
6. URIError


when Exception occurs
1. exception object gets created and thrown
2. it is checked whether user handles that exception or not(try-catch)
3. if No, that exception object goes to Default exception handler
   default exception handler-prints exception information and 
   stops program execution
4. if yes, exception goes to developer written exception handling code


Terminologies
-------------
1. try- containes a block statements where exception might occur
2. catch - actual exception handling code, this will be executed
	   only if exception is there in try
3. finally- contains the statements to be executed at any situation(important 
statements)
4. throw- to throw exception explicitely(user-defined exceptions)

N.p: - try block should be immediately followed by either a catch()
       or a finally{}
