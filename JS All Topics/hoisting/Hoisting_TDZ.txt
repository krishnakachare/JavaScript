Hoisting:
=========
-The process of assigning variable declarations a default value of 'undefined' during the creation phase is called Hoisting.
-In hoisting, the variable and function declarations are put into memory during the	compile/creation phase before code execution phase.

Temporal Dead Zone
==================
-The period between entering scope and being declared where they cannot be accessed. 
 This period is the temporal dead zone (TDZ).
-The state where variables are un-reachable. They are in memory, but they aren't usable.
-The let and const variables exist in the TDZ from the start of their enclosing scope until they are initialized.
-if a let/const variable is accessed before its declaration, it would throw a ReferenceError. Because of the TDZ.
