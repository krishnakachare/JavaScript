# Use of Regular Expression in JavaScript:
    The term Regex stands for Regular expression. The regex or regexp or regular expression is a sequence of different characters which describe the particular search pattern. It is also referred/called as a Rational expression.

    # Regular Expression Characters:
        There are following different type of characters of a regular expression:
           1. Metacharacters
           2. Quantifier
           3. Groups and Ranges
           4. Escape Characters or character classes



    You can easily use the regular expression in the JavaScript code by the help of following two string methods:
    
    Examples of Regular Expression in JavaScript:
        Example 1: This example uses the search() method in the JavaScript script for understanding the regular expression.
            search(): This method searches the regular expression in the string and also returns the position where the match found.

            var string = "Our Site is helpfull for studying about technical courses.!";   
            pattern="technical";  
            var res = string.search(pattern); /* This statement stores the position of the pattern in a string, if it is found in a string. */  
            document.write("Position of the pattern in a string:");   
            document.write(res);   

        
        Example 2: This example uses the replace() method in the JavaScript script for understanding the regular expression.
            Replace(): This method is used to return the string after the replacement of a matched character in a string.

            var string = "You are a Bad Student";   
            var pattern=/Bad/;  
            var replace="Good";  
            var res = string.replace(/Bad/,replace);    
            /* The above statement replaces the Bad word from the string by the Good word using the replace method. */  
            document.write("After replacing the substring, the modified string is:"+ '<br>');  
            document.write(res);
